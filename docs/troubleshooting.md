# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for VDE.

[← Back to README](../README.md)

## SSH Authentication Fails: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**Problem:** You try to connect but get "Permission denied (publickey)".

### Solution 1: Use the VM name (easiest)

```bash
# Instead of:
ssh localhost -p 2200

# Use the VM name:
ssh go-dev
```

The SSH config (auto-generated by VDE) handles everything.

### Solution 2: Specify the username manually

```bash
# Include the container username:
ssh devuser@localhost -p 2200
```

### Why this happens

Your computer has a username (like `alex`, `sam`, `jordan`). VDE containers use `devuser` as the username. When you run `ssh localhost`, SSH tries to log in as **your** username, which doesn't exist in the container.

### Quick reference

| VM | SSH Command | Port |
|----|-------------|------|
| Go | `ssh go-dev` or `ssh devuser@localhost -p 2208` | 2208 |
| Python | `ssh python-dev` or `ssh devuser@localhost -p 2203` | 2203 |
| Rust | `ssh rust-dev` or `ssh devuser@localhost -p 2204` | 2204 |

## Port Conflicts

**Problem:** A port is already in use.

```bash
# See what's using a port
lsof -i :2205

# Stop conflicting VM
vde stop go

# Restart VM
vde start go
```

---

## SSH Agent Issues

**Problem:** SSH agent forwarding not working.

```bash
# Check SSH agent is running
ps aux | grep ssh-agent

# Check SSH_AUTH_SOCK is set
echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK

# View loaded keys
ssh-add -l

# Restart SSH agent (VDE does this automatically, but you can manually)
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add

# Check SSH status
# Note: VDE handles SSH agent setup automatically. If you need to manually regenerate SSH config:
# VDE will regenerate it automatically on next VM start
```

**Problem:** VM-to-VM SSH not working.

```bash
# Check both VMs are running
docker ps | grep -E "python|go"

# Restart VMs to regenerate SSH config
vde restart python
vde restart go

# Test SSH connection
ssh -v python-dev
```

**Problem:** Git operations fail with authentication errors.

```bash
# Verify SSH agent has keys
ssh-add -l

# Add keys if needed
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Test GitHub/GitLab SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

---

## SSH Connection Issues

**Problem:** Can't connect to a VM via SSH.

```bash
# Check SSH config
ssh -v go-dev

# Verify container is running
docker ps | grep go-dev

# Check container logs
docker logs go-dev

# Restart SSHd in container
docker exec go-dev /usr/sbin/sshd
```

---

## Permission Denied

**Problem:** SSH permission denied error.

```bash
# Ensure correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

---

## Container Won't Start

**Problem:** Container fails to start.

```bash
# Check logs
docker logs <container-name>

# Rebuild with no cache
vde start <vm-name> --rebuild --no-cache

# Check docker-compose.yml syntax
docker-compose -f configs/docker/<vm-name>/docker-compose.yml config
```

---

## VSCode Remote-SSH Can't Connect

**Problem:** VSCode can't connect via Remote-SSH.

```bash
# Verify SSH works from terminal
ssh go-dev

# Check VSCode Remote-SSH settings
# ~/.ssh/config should be readable

# Try reloading VSCode window
# Cmd+Shift+P > "Developer: Reload Window"
```

---

## VM Already Exists

**Problem:** Can't create a VM that already exists.

```bash
# Just start it instead
vde start python

# Or check if it's running
vde status
# or
docker ps
```

---

## Unknown VM Type

**Problem:** "Unknown VM" error when creating.

```bash
# Check available VMs
vde list

# Use exact name from list
vde create python  # not "pyton"
```

---

## Data Persistence Issues

**Problem:** Data not persisting in service VMs.

```bash
# Check data directory exists
ls -la ~/data/postgres

# Verify volume mount in container
docker inspect postgres | grep -A 10 Mounts

# Don't remove and recreate - data is in ~/data/
```

---

## Docker Network Issues

**Problem:** Containers can't communicate.

```bash
# Check dev-net network exists
docker network ls | grep dev-net

# Recreate network if needed
docker network create dev-net

# Restart containers
vde restart all
```

---

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:

```bash
# Get general help
vde help

# List available VMs
vde list

# Check container logs
docker logs <container-name>
```

---

## Complete Reset

If something is seriously wrong and you want to start fresh:

```bash
# Stop everything
vde stop all

# Remove all containers (careful!)
docker ps -a | grep -E "dev$|[a-z]+$" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f

# You can now recreate VMs from scratch
vde create python
```
