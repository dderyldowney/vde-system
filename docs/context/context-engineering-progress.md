## Project Configuration

### Essential Project Context

**Project Type**: Docker-based virtual development environment system  
**Architecture**: Hub-and-Spoke model with dual-project ecosystem  
**Tech Stack**:
- **Shell**: Zsh 5.0+ (Strict requirement - no bash allowed)
- **Orchestration**: Docker Desktop/Engine
- **Version Control**: Git 2.30+
- **Connectivity**: SSH (vde_student identity key)
- **Language**: Shell (zsh) - Core tooling, Python/Node/Go/etc. for spoked containers

**Project Structure**:
- **The Armor (@armor)**: Student-facing development engine, AI-blind and Hub-blind
- **The Forge (@forge)**: AI-governance system enforcing Rule Spine and managing lifecycle

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning ✓ COMPLETED

**Status**: Complete - Delivered comprehensive system analysis

**Findings**:
- **Existing Documentation**: Comprehensive governance structure with 9-document Sovereign Artifact Set
- **Project Maturity**: High - Well-established architectural principles and governance framework
- **System Design**: Clear dual-project architecture (Armor + Forge) with strong separation of concerns
- **Technical Standards**: Rigorous enforcement via UAP and architectural tagging mandates
- **Epistemic Architecture**: VDE implements constrained epistemic agent architecture (mapped to arxiv 2506.17331)

**System Architecture Analysis**:

**Dual-Project Structure**:
1. **The Armor (@armor)**: Student-facing VDE Engine
   - Core libraries: vde-core, vde-constants, vde-docker, vde-ssh
   - CLI orchestration: bin/vde (unified command router)
   - Lifecycle management: vde-init, vde-create, vde-rebuild, vde-start, etc.
   - Infrastructure: vde-health, vde-info, vde-ps, vde-logs

2. **The Forge (@forge)**: AI-Governance System
   - UAP enforcement: vde-enforce-uap.zsh
   - Auditing: vde-gospel-audit.zsh, vde-security-audit.zsh, vde-spine-check.zsh
   - Testing: BDD features, integration tests
   - Governance: Architectural tagging, Conventional Commits, GitHub lifecycle

**Core Library Components (24 libraries identified)**:
- **Core Logic**: vde-core, vde-commands, vde-parser
- **Docker Management**: vde-docker, vde-docker-state
- **Security**: vde-security, vde-root-guard, vde-ssh
- **State Management**: vde-docker-state, vm-lock, vde-root
- **Utilities**: vde-audit, vde-cluster-utils, vde-constants, vde-errors, vde-health, vde-log, vde-metrics, vde-naming, vde-path-utils, vde-progress, vde-shell-compat, vde-templates, vm-common

**CLI Tools (56 scripts in bin/ identified)**:
- **Lifecycle**: vde-init, vde-bootstrap, vde-path-of-the-foundling
- **Container Management**: vde-create (via vde), vde-rebuild, vde-start, vde-stop, vde-remove
- **Access**: vde-enter, vde-exec, vde-ssh-setup, vde-ssh-sync
- **Operations**: vde-health, vde-info, vde-ps, vde-logs, vde-port
- **System**: vde-networks, vde-images, vde-cluster, vde-rebuild-cache
- **Governance**: vde-enforce-uap.zsh, vde-gospel-audit.zsh, vde-security-audit.zsh, vde-spine-check.zsh
- **Maintenance**: vde-prune.zsh, vde-purify-paths.zsh, vde-heal-docs.zsh, vde-check-tetrad.zsh

**Architecture Patterns Identified**:
1. **Hub-and-Spoke**: Host (Hub) + Containers (Spokes) + SSH Bridge
2. **Lock-Queue**: FIFO serialization preventing Thundering Herd conditions
3. **Universal Script Parity**: All VMs point to setup scripts
4. **Born Ready**: Containers configured at build time, no runtime dependencies
5. **Sovereign Artifact Set**: 9 documents move as single artifact

## Next Steps for Continuation

### When Continuing in New Chat:

1. **Read this file first** to understand project context and current state
2. **Check "Completed Phases"** to see what's been documented
3. **Check "Current Work"** for what was being worked on
4. **Check "Next Actions"** for specific tasks to continue

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 Completion):

1. Complete component analysis (bin/, lib/, tests/ directories)
2. Create documentation structure proposal
3. Confirm Phase 1 completion with user
4. Wait for user confirmation before Phase 2

### Phase 2 Preparation:

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 will create:
- `project-overview.md` (master navigation file)
- 3-5 key ADRs documenting major architectural decisions
- 5-8 component context files for core system parts
- Standardized templates for future expansion

## Notes for AI Agents

### How to Work on This Project

1. **Always read PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY.md first** - This establishes the Mandalorian Creed framework
2. **Respect the UAP** - ZSH only, zero-host dependency, Born Ready containers
3. **Follow the hierarchy** - CREED → ARMORER CREED → Tooling/Workflow rules
4. **Use existing governance documents** - The 9-document Sovereign Artifact Set is authoritative
5. **Maintain narrative consistency** - This project uses Mandalorian/Forge mythos as governance framework

### Key Constraints

- **NO BASH** - All shell scripts must use ZSH
- **NO HOST DEPENDENCIES** - Only Zsh, Git, Docker, SSH allowed
- **NO RUNTIME APT** - Containers must be Born Ready (configured at build time)
- **IDENTITY FIRST** - Always operate as devuser inside spokes
- **WORKSPACE PERSISTENCE** - Code goes in $HOME/workspace/ for sync to hub

### Common Patterns

- **Scout sub-agents** for research, main agent for cognition
- **Decompose found solutions** - never use wholesale
- **Identity-level constraints** - not just rule-level
- **Let technology push back** - that's information, not failure
- **Triple binary gate contract** for all agent work
