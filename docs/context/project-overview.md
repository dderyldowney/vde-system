## Project Essentials

### Purpose
VDE is a sovereign, template-based ecosystem of Dockerized Spokes designed for developers who demand absolute isolation, consistent hydration, and governed development. It provides a deterministic containerized environment for software engineering with strict architectural governance.

### Tech Stack
- **Shell**: Zsh 5.0+ (strict requirement - NO bash allowed)
- **Orchestration**: Docker Desktop/Engine 20.10+
- **Version Control**: Git 2.30+
- **Connectivity**: SSH (vde_student identity key)
- **Language**: Shell (zsh) - Core tooling, Python/Node/Go/etc. for spoked containers

### Architecture Pattern
**Hub-and-Spoke Model**:
- **The Hub**: Host machine governing orchestration, security, and global configuration
- **The Spokes**: Isolated containers (jails) where hydration and development occur
- **The Transversal Bridge**: SSH-native connection between Hub and Spokes

### Dual-Project Architecture
1. **The Armor (@armor)**: Student-facing VDE Engine - AI-blind, Hub-blind, depends only on the Tetrad
2. **The Forge (@forge)**: Development AI-Governance System - enforces Rule Spine, manages GitHub lifecycle
3. **The Spinal Cord (@shared-law)**: Shared foundational pillars used by both projects

---

## Current Focus
**Version 1.5.4 (The Sovereign Baseline)** — CERTIFIED:
- Version sync from 1.5.3 to 1.5.4 complete
- Heartbeat: 72/72 BDD steps green (6/6 scenarios)
- All Sovereign Artifact Set documents aligned to 1.5.4
- Branching strategy: develop → stable → main

## Key Context Files

### Sovereign Artifact Set (The Gospel - Authoritative Documents)
These 9 documents move as a single artifact and must be in perfect agreement before any release:
1. `docs/architecture/overview.md` - High-level system design and structural principles
2. `docs/architecture/data-flow.md` - Granular component logic and workflows
3. `docs/changelogs/current.md` - Historical record of all Sovereign Baseline releases
4. `docs/governance/vde-spec.md` - Version authority and system laws (The Gospel Lead)
5. `USE_CASES.md` - Defines the "Why" and filters work by educational value
6. `VDE_ANALYSIS.md` - Research findings and empirical engineering verdicts
7. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Authoritative record of active system health and state
8. `docs/governance/sovereign-charter.md` - The dual-mission constitution (Armor + Forge)
9. `docs/api/library-api.md` - The main library reference

### Additional Essential Documentation
- `docs/governance/project-philosophy.md` - The Mandalorian Creed framework and epistemic architecture
- `docs/governance/vde-epistemic-mapping.md` - VDE governance mapped to arxiv 2506.17331 (epistemic integrity)
- `docs/development/github-lifecycle.md` - Signet (Issue) and Chronicle (PR) rituals
- `docs/governance/vde-protocol.md` - The Laws of the Forge and branching strategy
- `docs/guides/getting-started.md` - Complete walkthrough for students

## AI Collaboration Notes

### Coding Standards
- **Mandate C (ZSH Only)**: All scripts MUST use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh`
- **Mandate L (Proof of Life)**: The lifecycle (init, create, rebuild, start, enter, stop, remove, add, uninstall) is the project's Heartbeat
- **Mandate 24 (Architectural Tagging)**: Every file tagged as `@armor`, `@forge`, or `@shared-law` on line 2 or 3
- **Pure Relative Pathing**: All artifacts accessed relative to VDE_ROOT_DIR for portability

### Common Patterns
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Host orchestration + isolated containers + SSH bridge
- **Lock-Queue**: FIFO serialization preventing Thundering Herd race conditions
- **Universal Script Parity (USP)**: All VMs point to setup scripts in `scripts/setup/<alias>-init.zsh`
- **Born Ready**: Containers configured at build time - NO runtime apt calls
- **Sovereign Artifact Set**: 9 documents move as single synchronized artifact

### Important Constraints
- **NO BASH**: Strict ZSH-only requirement enforced by UAP sentinel
- **NO HOST DEPENDENCIES**: Only Zsh, Git, Docker, SSH allowed (Scavenger's Ban)
- **NO RUNTIME APT**: Containers must be Born Ready (configured at build time)
- **IDENTITY FIRST**: Always operate as devuser inside spokes using vde_student key
- **WORKSPACE PERSISTENCE**: Code goes in $HOME/workspace/ for sync to hub
- **AI-BLIND RUNTIME**: The Forge is not available during Armor runtime - Armor must function autonomously

### Epistemic Architecture
VDE implements a constrained epistemic agent architecture (mapped to arxiv 2506.17331):
- **Scout sub-agents** for research, main agent for cognition
- **Decompose found solutions** - never use wholesale
- **Identity-level constraints** - not just rule-level (the Contract)
- **Let technology push back** - that's information, not failure
- **Triple binary gate contract** for all agent work
- **The Helmet Mandate**: Never fabricate knowledge - that's removing the helmet

## The Unyielding Tetrad (System Spine)

The system requires these four pillars to operate:

1. **Zsh** (The Voice) - Version 5.0+ with native associative array support
2. **Git** (The Chronicler) - Version 2.30+ enforcing Conventional Commits
3. **Docker** (The World-Forge) - Version 20.10+ managing Spoke lifecycles
4. **SSH** (The Transversal Bridge) - Requires vde_student identity in Hub's agent

Before any mission, the Four Pillars Gateway (`vde health` or `vde spine-check`) verifies these pillars are present and functional.
