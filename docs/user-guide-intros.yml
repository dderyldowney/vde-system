      Hey there! 👋 Ready to set up your awesome new development playground?
      
      Don't worry — we know setup can feel intimidating. But guess what? You're going to do great, and we'll be right here with you every step of the way.
      
      ### What You Need Before Starting
      
      Think of this like checking your backpack before a hike. You only need a few things:
      
      **What you need:**
      - [ ] Docker Desktop installed and running (this is the engine that makes everything go)
      - [ ] Git installed (for downloading the VDE code)
      - [ ] Zsh 5.0+ or Bash 4.0+ (fancy names for your terminal — we'll explain!)
      - [ ] About 5GB of free disk space (roughly the size of a few HD movies)
      
      **Don't have these?** No stress! We'll walk you through getting each one. Just find your computer type below and follow along.
      
      ---
      
      ## Let's Get You Set Up! 🚀
      
      If you don't have Docker Desktop or git installed yet, that's totally fine! We'll hold your hand through the whole process. Just find your section below — Windows, Mac, or Linux — and follow the steps.
      
      You've got this!
      
      ---
      
      ## Installing Docker Desktop
      
      Docker Desktop is the magic engine that runs all your development environments. Think of it like the kitchen where all your coding recipes come to life. 🍳
      
      ### For Windows Users
      
      #### Step 1: Check if You Have the Right Version of Windows
      
      Docker Desktop likes Windows 10 or Windows 11. It also prefers **Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education** - it's a bit picky about Windows Home edition (but don't worry, we have a workaround!)
      
      **Let's check what you have:**
      
      1. Press the **Windows key** on your keyboard (or click Start)
      2. Type **"About your PC"** and press Enter
      3. Look for "Windows specifications"
      4. Under "Edition", you should see **Windows 10 Pro** or **Windows 11 Pro** (or Enterprise/Education)
      
      **If you see Windows Home:** You can still use Docker with WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This is free from Microsoft. Here's how:
      1. Press Windows key, type **"PowerShell"**
      2. Right-click "Windows PowerShell" and select **"Run as administrator"**
      3. Copy and paste this command (right-click in PowerShell to paste):
         ```
         wsl --install
         ```
      4. Press Enter and wait for it to finish
      5. Restart your computer when asked
      
      #### Step 2: Download Docker Desktop for Windows
      
      1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
      2. Go to: **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop**
      3. Click the big blue button that says **"Download for Windows"**
      4. The file will be named something like `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`
      5. When the download finishes, click the file to open it (usually in the bottom-left corner of your browser)
      
      #### Step 3: Install Docker Desktop
      
      1. A window will pop up asking for permission - click **"Yes"**
      2. You'll see an installer window - make sure these boxes are checked:
         - ☑ **Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V** (recommended)
      3. Click **"Ok"**
      4. Wait for the installation to complete (this may take a few minutes)
      5. Click **"Close"** when it's done
      6. **Restart your computer** when asked
      
      #### Step 4: Start Docker Desktop
      
      1. After your computer restarts, you'll see a Docker icon in your taskbar (bottom of screen) or a notification
      2. Click the Docker icon to start it
      3. A welcome window will appear - accept the terms and click **"Accept"**
      4. Docker will start - wait for the whale icon in your taskbar to stop spinning and turn solid
      5. When the whale is solid (not spinning), Docker is ready!
      
      #### Step 5: Verify Docker is Working
      
      1. Press the **Windows key**, type **"PowerShell"**, and open it
      2. Type this command and press Enter:
         ```
         docker --version
         ```
      3. You should see something like `Docker version 24.x.x, build xxxxx`
      
      **🎉 Awesome!** Docker is installed and ready to go! You're doing great!
      
      ---
      
      ### For macOS (Mac) Users
      
      #### Step 1: Check if Your Mac is Friendly with Docker
      
      Good news — most modern Macs work beautifully with Docker! It's happy on:
      - **Intel-based Macs**: macOS 11 or newer (Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia)
      - **Apple Silicon Macs** (M1/M2/M3 chips): macOS 11 or newer
      
      **How to check your macOS version:**
      
      1. Click the **Apple menu** () in the top-left corner of your screen
      2. Select **"About This Mac"**
      3. You'll see the macOS version number and your chip type
      
      #### Step 2: Download Docker Desktop for Mac
      
      1. Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
      2. Go to: **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop**
      3. You'll see two options - choose the right one for your Mac:
         - **"Download for Mac - Apple Chip"** → if you have M1/M2/M3/M4
         - **"Download for Mac - Intel Chip"** → if you have an Intel processor
      4. The file will be named `Docker.dmg`
      5. When the download finishes, double-click the file to open it (usually in your Downloads folder)
      
      #### Step 3: Install Docker Desktop
      
      1. A window will open showing a Docker icon and a folder called **"Applications"**
      2. **Drag the Docker icon** onto the **"Applications"** folder
      3. Wait for the copy to finish (a few seconds)
      4. Close the window
      5. Open your **Applications** folder (click Go → Applications in the menu bar, or use Spotlight)
      6. Find **Docker** and double-click it
      7. If you see a warning about downloaded from the internet:
         - Click **"Open"** to confirm
      
      #### Step 4: Complete the Setup
      
      1. Docker will ask for permission - enter your Mac password
      2. Read the Welcome screen and click **"Continue"**
      3. A popup will ask for system permissions:
         - Click **"Open System Settings"** (or "Open System Preferences")
         - You'll see Docker under "Login Items" or similar - the switches should be turned on
         - If any switches are off, click them to turn on (you'll need to enter your password)
      4. Go back to the Docker welcome window and click **"Got it!"** or continue through the setup
      
      #### Step 5: Wait for Docker to Start
      
      1. Look at the top of your screen (menu bar) for a whale icon 🐳
      2. At first, it will be animated (the whale is doing something) - wait for this
      3. When the whale stops moving and becomes solid, Docker is ready!
      
      #### Step 6: Verify Docker is Working
      
      1. Open **Terminal** (press Command+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
      2. Type this command and press Enter:
         ```
         docker --version
         ```
      3. You should see something like `Docker version 24.x.x, build xxxxx`
      
      **✨ Perfect!** Docker is all set up on your Mac! Looking good!

      ### For Linux Users
      
      Linux users — you're our kind of people! 🐧 Docker Desktop plays nicely with Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and many other distributions.
      
      #### Step 1: Let's See Which Linux Flavor You Have
      
      First, let's check which distribution you're rocking:
      
      1. Open your **Terminal** (press Ctrl+Alt+T)
      2. Type this command and press Enter:
         ```
         cat /etc/os-release
         ```
      3. Look for the `NAME=` line - this tells you your distribution (e.g., "Ubuntu", "Fedora", "Debian")
      
      #### Step 2: Download Docker Desktop
      
      1. Open your web browser
      2. Go to: **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop**
      3. Click **"Download for Linux"**
      4. You'll see options for different Linux versions - click yours:
         - **Ubuntu/Debian** → `.deb` file
         - **Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat** → `.rpm` file
      5. The file will download to your **Downloads** folder
      
      #### Step 3: Install Docker Desktop
      
      **For Ubuntu/Debian (.deb file):**
      
      1. Open your terminal
      2. Type these commands one at a time, pressing Enter after each:
      
         ```bash
         # Go to your Downloads folder
         cd ~/Downloads
      
         # Update your package list
         sudo apt-get update
      
         # Install Docker (replace the filename with your actual downloaded file)
         sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.deb
         ```
      
         *Note: The actual filename will be something like `docker-desktop-4.25.0-amd64.deb` - type `ls` to see the exact name and use that.*
      
      **For Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat (.rpm file):**
      
      1. Open your terminal
      2. Type these commands one at a time, pressing Enter after each:

      ## Installing Git
      
      Git is like a digital delivery truck — it downloads code from the internet (like the VDE code) right to your computer. Handy little thing! 📦
      
      ### For Windows Users
      
      #### Option 1: The Easiest Way (Git for Windows)
      
      **Step 1: Download Git for Windows**
      
      1. Open your web browser
      2. Go to: **https://github.com/git-guides/install-git**
      3. Look for the **Windows** section
      4. Click the link that says **"Click here to download"** (or go directly to https://git-scm.com/download/win)
      5. The file will be named something like `Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe`
      
      **Step 2: Install Git**
      
      1. When the download finishes, click the file to run it
      2. If Windows asks for permission, click **"Yes"**
      3. Click **"Next"** on the welcome screen
      4. Keep clicking **"Next"** to accept all the default settings (they're good for most people)
      5. On the "Choosing the default editor" screen, **Vim** will be selected - we recommend changing this to **Notepad** or **Notepad++** (easier to use)
      6. Keep clicking **"Next"** through the rest
      7. On the final screen, click **"Install"**
      8. Wait for it to finish, then click **"Finish"**
      
      **Step 3: Verify Git is Installed**
      
      1. Press the **Windows key**, type **"PowerShell"**, and open it
      2. Type this command and press Enter:
         ```
         git --version
         ```
      3. You should see something like `git version 2.43.0.windows.1`
      
      **🎊 Sweet!** Git is ready to go on Windows! Halfway there!
      
      ---
      
      ### For macOS (Mac) Users
      
      #### The Good News: You Might Already Have Git!
      
      Macs come with Git built-in! Let's check if you're all set:
      
      1. Open **Terminal** (press Command+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
      2. Type this and press Enter:
         ```
         git --version
         ```
      3. If you see a version number like `git version 2.39.0`, you already have Git! **You're done!**
      
      #### If You Need to Install Git
      
      If you don't have Git or want a newer version, here's how:
      
      **Option 1: Install with Homebrew (Easiest)**
      
      1. Open Terminal
      2. First, check if you have Homebrew (a package installer for Mac):
         ```
         brew --version
         ```
      3. If you see a version, great! Install Git with:
         ```
         brew install git
         ```
      4. If you DON'T have Homebrew, you can install it first:
         ```
         /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
         ```
         Then install Git with: `brew install git`
      
      **Option 2: Download from Git Website**
      
      1. Go to: **https://github.com/git-guides/install-git**
      2. Look for the **macOS** section
      3. Click the download link (or go to https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
      4. This will download a `.dmg` file
      5. Double-click the file to open it
      6. Follow the same steps as installing Docker (drag to Applications)
      
      **Verify Git is Working:**
      
      In Terminal, type:
      ```
      git --version
      ```
      
      You should see a version number. **✅ Done!** You've got Git!
      
      ---
      
      ### For Linux Users
      
      #### The Good News: Most Linux Has Git Already!
      
      Linux is usually prepared for everything. Let's see:
      
      1. Open your terminal
      2. Type:
         ```
         git --version
         ```
      3. If you see a version, you're done!
      
      #### If You Need to Install Git
      
      **For Ubuntu/Debian:**
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install git
      ```
      
      **For Fedora:**
      ```bash
      sudo dnf install git
      ```
      
      **For CentOS/Red Hat:**
      ```bash
      sudo yum install git
      ```
      
      **For Arch Linux:**
      ```bash
      sudo pacman -S git
      ```
      
      **Verify Git is Working:**
      
      In your terminal, type:
      ```
      git --version
      ```
      
      You should see a version number. **✅ You're set!**
      
      ---
      
      ## Installing Zsh and Bash
      
      Okay, quick confession: "shell" is just a fancy name for the program that runs in your terminal and understands your commands. VDE needs a modern one — specifically **Zsh 5.0+** or **Bash 4.0+**. Sound scary? Don't worry, we'll sort you out!
      
      **Why does VDE need this?**
      - VDE's commands are written in shell language (fancy nerd talk for "scripts that run in your terminal")
      - Older shells don't understand some of the cool tricks we use
      - The good news: Zsh comes standard on modern Macs, and most Linux has modern Bash
      
      Think of it like VDE speaks a specific dialect, and we need to make sure your terminal understands it! 🗣️
      
      ### For Windows Users
      
      #### The Good News: Git for Windows Includes Bash!
      
      If you installed Git for Windows (which you did in the previous section), you **already have Bash**! Git for Windows includes a program called "Git Bash" that gives you a modern Bash shell.
      
      **How to check if you have it:**
      
      1. Press the **Windows key** and type **"Git Bash"**
      2. If you see "Git Bash" in the results, click it to open
      3. A terminal window will open - this is your Bash shell!
      4. Type this and press Enter:
         ```
         bash --version
         ```
      5. You should see something like `GNU bash, version 5.x.x` - this is perfect!
      
      **If you don't see Git Bash:**
      - Reinstall Git for Windows using the instructions from the "Installing Git" section
      - Make sure to select "Git Bash" as one of the components during installation
      
      #### Installing Zsh on Windows (Optional)
      
      Zsh is available on Windows through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
      
      **If you already have WSL installed (from the Docker section):**
      
      1. Open **PowerShell** and run:
         ```
         wsl
         ```
      2. Once in WSL, install Zsh:
         ```bash
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install zsh
         ```
      3. Check the version:
         ```bash
         zsh --version
         ```
      4. You should see something like `zsh 5.x.x or greater`
      
      **If you don't have WSL:**
      - Don't worry! Git Bash is sufficient for VDE
      - You can install WSL later if you want to use Zsh
      
      #### What Shell Should You Use?
      
      **For VDE on Windows:**
      - **Git Bash** (recommended) - Already installed with Git, works great
      - **WSL + Zsh** (optional) - More powerful, but requires WSL setup
      
      ---
      
      ### For macOS (Mac) Users
      
      #### The Good News: You Almost Certainly Already Have Zsh!
      
      Modern macOS comes with Zsh as the default shell (since macOS Catalina).
      
      **How to check what shell you have:**
      
      1. Open **Terminal** (press Command+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
      2. Check if Zsh is running by default:
         ```
         echo $SHELL
         ```
      3. If you see `/bin/zsh`, you're already using Zsh - great!
      4. Check the Zsh version:
         ```
         zsh --version
         ```
      5. You should see `zsh 5.x.x or greater` - this is perfect!
      
      #### If You Need to Install or Update Zsh
      
      **Check if you need an update:**
      ```bash
      zsh --version
      ```
      
      If the version is less than 5.0, or if Zsh isn't installed:
      
      **Option 1: Use Homebrew (Easiest)**
      
      1. If you have Homebrew (from the Git section), install the latest Zsh:
         ```bash
         brew install zsh
         ```
      
      2. Set Zsh as your default shell:
         ```bash
         chsh -s /bin/zsh
         ```
         (You'll need to enter your password)
      
      3. Close and reopen Terminal - you're now using Zsh!
      
      **Option 2: macOS Already Has Zsh (Just Need to Switch)**
      
      If Zsh is installed but not your default:
      
      1. Check if Zsh exists:
         ```bash
         ls /bin/zsh
         ```
      2. If it exists, switch to it:
         ```bash
         chsh -s /bin/zsh
         ```
      3. Close and reopen Terminal
      
      #### Installing Bash on macOS (Optional)
      
      macOS comes with Bash, but it's an older version (3.2.x). For VDE, you can use either Zsh or install a modern Bash.
      
      **If you want the latest Bash:**
      
      ```bash
      brew install bash
      ```
      
      Check the version:
      ```bash
      brew list bash | grep bin
      # This shows where bash is installed, usually /usr/local/bin/bash
      /usr/local/bin/bash --version
      ```
      
      You should see `bash 5.x.x or greater`
      
      #### What Shell Should You Use?
      
      **For VDE on macOS:**
      - **Zsh** (recommended) - Already installed, modern, and is the macOS default
      - **Bash** (optional) - Install via Homebrew if you prefer Bash
      
      ---
      
      ### For Linux Users
      
      #### Check What You Already Have
      
      Most modern Linux distributions come with modern versions of Bash and Zsh pre-installed.
      
      **Check your Bash version:**
      ```bash
      bash --version
      ```
      
      **Check if Zsh is installed:**
      ```bash
      zsh --version
      ```
      
      **What you should see:**
      - Bash: `version 4.0 or greater` (most Linux has 4.x or 5.x)
      - Zsh: `version 5.0 or greater` (if installed)
      
      #### If You Need to Install or Upgrade
      
      **For Ubuntu/Debian:**
      
      ```bash
      # Install or update Bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install bash
      
      # Install Zsh
      sudo apt-get install zsh
      ```
      
      **For Fedora:**
      
      ```bash
      # Install or update Bash
      sudo dnf install bash
      
      # Install Zsh
      sudo dnf install zsh
      ```
      
      **For CentOS/Red Hat:**
      
      ```bash
      # Install or update Bash
      sudo yum install bash
      
      # Install Zsh
      sudo yum install zsh
      ```
      
      **For Arch Linux:**
      
      ```bash
      # Install or update Bash
      sudo pacman -S bash
      
      # Install Zsh
      sudo pacman -S zsh
      ```
      
      #### Verify Your Installation
      
      **Check Bash version:**
      ```bash
      bash --version
      # Should show 4.0 or greater
      ```
      
      **Check Zsh version:**
      ```bash
      zsh --version
      # Should show 5.0 or greater
      ```
      
      #### Make Zsh Your Default Shell (Optional)
      
      If you want to use Zsh instead of Bash as your daily shell:
      
      ```bash
      chsh -s $(which zsh)
      ```
      
      Log out and log back in for the change to take effect.
      
      #### What Shell Should You Use?
      
      **For VDE on Linux:**
      - **Bash** (recommended) - Almost certainly already installed and modern
      - **Zsh** (optional) - Install if you prefer Zsh's features

      ## Quick Checklist: Are You Ready? 🎯
      
      Let's do a quick victory lap before we move on! Open your terminal and run these commands:
      
      **Open your terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run:**
      
      ```bash
      # Check Docker
      docker --version
      
      # Check Git
      git --version
      
      # Check Docker is actually running
      docker ps
      ```
      
      **What you should see:**
      - `docker --version` → Shows Docker version number (like "Docker version 24.x.x")
      - `git --version` → Shows Git version number (like "git version 2.x.x")
      - `docker ps` → Shows a list of containers (might be empty, and that's totally okay!)
      
      **If `docker ps` gives an error like "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon":**
      - Docker Desktop probably isn't running — just start it from your applications
      - Wait for the whale icon to stop spinning (it's thinking! 🐳)
      - Then try again
      
      ---
      
      ## Stuck? We Can Help! 🆘
      
      If you run into any hiccups installing Docker, Git, or shells:
      
      1. **Docker won't start?** Make sure your computer is compatible and you've restarted after installation
      2. **Can't find the terminal?**
         - Windows: Press Windows key, type "PowerShell", "Windows Terminal", or "Git Bash"
         - Mac: Press Command+Space, type "Terminal"
         - Linux: Press Ctrl+Alt+T
      3. **Permission errors?** Make sure you have administrator rights on your computer
      4. **Shell not found?** On Windows, make sure you installed Git for Windows - it includes Git Bash
      5. **Version too old?** On macOS, use Homebrew to install the latest version. On Linux, use your package manager
      
      Once Docker, Git, and a modern shell are installed and working, you're ready for the fun part! You've made it through the setup — you're awesome! 🌟

      ### Step 1: Clone VDE to Your Computer
      
      **Scenario: Getting the VDE code**
      
      ```
      Given I want to install VDE
      When I clone the VDE repository to ~/dev
      Then VDE files should be in place
      ```
      
      **Let's download VDE! Open your terminal and run:**
      ```bash
      # Clone the repository (replace with your repository URL)
      # For example: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vde.git ~/dev
      git clone YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE ~/dev

      # Go into the directory
      cd ~/dev
      ```
      
      ### Step 2: Run the Initial Setup
      
      **Scenario: First-time setup creates everything**
      
      ```
      Given I have cloned VDE to ~/dev
      And I'm running the setup for the first time
      When I run the initial setup script
      Then VDE should be properly installed
      And required directories should be created
      ```
      
      **Run the setup:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/build-and-start
      ```
      
      **What this does:**
      - Creates all necessary directories (configs, projects, data, logs, etc.)
      - Sets up proper file permissions
      - Initializes the VDE framework
      
      ### Step 3: Verify Installation
      
      **Scenario: Checking that VDE is ready**
      
      ```
      Given I've just installed VDE
      When I run "vde list"
      Then I should see all predefined VM types
      And python, rust, js, csharp, ruby should be listed
      And postgres, redis, mongodb, nginx should be listed
      ```
      
      **Verify everything is ready:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde list
      ```
      
      **Expected output:** You should see a list of available language and service VMs.
      
      **Woohoo! 🎉** You're all set up and ready to go!

    order: 2
    intro: |
      ### SSH Keys? Automatic! 🔑
      
      Here's some good news: VDE handles SSH keys for you automatically. We wanted to mention this so you know what's happening, but you don't need to do anything. It's like magic! ✨
      
      ### Automatic SSH Key Generation
      
      **Scenario: SSH keys are created if you don't have them**
      
      ```
      Given I'm setting up VDE for the first time
      And no SSH keys exist on my system
      When SSH keys are checked
      Then ed25519 keys should be generated automatically
      And public keys should be copied to VMs
      ```
      
      **What happens:**
      1. VDE checks if you have SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
      2. If not, it creates them for you automatically
      3. Public keys are copied to the `public-ssh-keys/` directory
      4. VMs are configured to use these keys for access
      
      ### Your SSH Config is Updated Automatically
      
      **Scenario: SSH config is set up for you**
      
      ```
      Given SSH config file does not exist
      When I create my first VM
      Then SSH config should be created
      And SSH config entry for the VM should be added
      And I can connect using simple names like "python-dev"
      ```
      
      **You don't need to:**
      - Manually create SSH keys
      - Edit your SSH config file
      - Copy keys to VMs
      - Set up SSH agent forwarding
      
      **VDE does all of this for you.** Sit back and relax! ☕

      ### Starting Your VM
      
      **Scenario: Starting a stopped VM**
      
      ```
      Given I created a Python VM earlier
      And it's currently stopped
      When I run "vde start python"
      Then the Python VM should start
      And I can connect to it
      ```
      
      **Command:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde start python
      ```

      ### Time to Build Something Real! 🏗️
      
      Now let's build a real application stack. This is where VDE really shines — you can have multiple VMs working together like a well-oiled machine.
      
      ### What We're Building
      
      You'll have a complete tech stack:
      - **Python VM** — Your application code (port 2200)
      - **PostgreSQL VM** — Your database (port 2400)
      - **Redis VM** — Your cache (port 2401)
      
      All three can talk to each other automatically. No networking headaches required!
      
      ### Creating Your Service VMs
      
      **Scenario: Creating database and cache VMs**
      
      ```
      Given I have VDE installed
      And I need a database and cache
      When I run "vde create postgres"
      And I run "vde create redis"
      Then PostgreSQL VM configuration should be created
      And Redis VM configuration should be created
      ```
      
      **Create both services:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde create postgres
      ./scripts/vde create redis
      ```
      
      ### Starting Your Full Stack
      
      **Scenario: Starting all three VMs together**
      
      ```
      Given I created VMs for python, postgres, and redis
      When I run "vde start python postgres redis"
      Then all three VMs should be running
      And Python VM can connect to PostgreSQL
      And Python VM can connect to Redis
      ```
      
      **Start your full stack:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde start python postgres redis
      ```
      
      ### Verifying Your Cluster is Running
      
      **Scenario: Checking all VMs are communicating**
      
      ```
      Given I started python, postgres, and redis
      When I check VM status
      Then I should see all three running
      And they should be on the same Docker network
      ```
      
      **Check status:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde list
      ```
      
      **Expected output:**
      ```
      VM          Type        Status    Port
      ----------------------------------------
      python      language    running   2200
      postgres    service     running   2400

      ```
      Given I have a Python VM running
      When I run "ssh python-dev"
      Then I should be connected to the Python VM
      And I should be in the projects/python directory
      ```
      
      **Connect:**
      ```bash
      ssh python-dev
      ```
      
      **You're now inside your VM!** You can:
      - Run Python code
      - Install packages
      - Edit files in `projects/python/`
      - Access postgres and redis seamlessly
      - Feel like a pro developer (because you are one!) 🌟
      
      ### Exiting a VM
      
      **To leave:** Just type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`. The door is always open!

      ### Databases? No Problem! 🗄️
      
      VDE makes working with databases delightfully simple. Your Python VM can talk to PostgreSQL as easily as if it were running on the same machine (because, well, virtually it is!).
      
      **Scenario: Connecting from Python to PostgreSQL**
      
      ```
      Given I have Python and PostgreSQL running
      When I SSH into python-dev
      And I run "psql -h postgres -U devuser"
      Then I should be connected to PostgreSQL
      And I can run database queries
      ```
      
      **Try it yourself:**
      ```bash
      # 1. Connect to your Python VM
      ssh python-dev
      
      # 2. Connect to PostgreSQL from within the VM
      psql -h postgres -U devuser
      
      # 3. You're now in PostgreSQL! Try:
      # \list                    # List databases
      # \c devuser               # Connect to default database
      # \dt                      # List tables
      # SELECT 1;                # Run a query
      # \q                       # Quit
      ```
      
      ### Your Database Data Persists
      
      **Scenario: Database data survives rebuilds**
      
      ```
      Given I created tables in PostgreSQL
      When I rebuild the PostgreSQL VM
      And I reconnect to PostgreSQL
      Then my tables should still exist
      ```
      
      **Important:** Database data in `~/dev/data/postgres/` persists even when you rebuild VMs. Your precious data is safe and sound! 💾

      Then all VMs should be running
      And I can start working immediately
      ```
      
      **One command to start your day:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde start python postgres redis
      ```
      
      ### During the Day: Check In on Your VMs
      
      **Scenario: Checking VM status**
      
      ```
      Given I've been working for a while
      When I want to know what's running
      Then I should see all running VMs
      And their status should be clear
      ```
      
      **Check status:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde list
      ```
      
      ### End of Day: Shut It Down
      
      **Scenario: Clean shutdown**
      
      ```
      Given multiple VMs are running
      When I run "vde stop all"
      Then all VMs should stop gracefully
      And my work is saved
      ```
      
      **Stop everything:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde stop all
      ```
      
      **Good night, VDE!** See you tomorrow! 🌙

      ### Want to Learn More Languages? 🌍
      
      One of the beautiful things about VDE is how easy it is to try new languages! No installation headaches — just create a VM and start coding. Let's add another language to your collection!
      
      **Scenario: Adding Rust to your environment**
      
      ```
      Given I have Python running
      And I want to work with Rust
      When I run "vde create rust"
      And I run "vde start rust"
      Then Rust VM should be running
      And I can use both Python and Rust
      ```
      
      **Add Rust:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde create rust
      ./scripts/vde start rust
      ```
      
      ### Starting Multiple Language VMs
      
      **Scenario: Working with multiple languages**
      
      ```
      Given I created VMs for Python, Rust, and JavaScript
      When I run "vde start python rust js"
      Then all three language VMs should be running
      And I can switch between them
      ```
      
      **Start multiple at once:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde start python rust js
      ```
      
      **Polyglot programmer?** Why not! 😎

      ### Hiccups Happen — We've Got Your Back! 🛠️
      
      Sometimes things don't work perfectly the first time. That's okay! Here's how to handle common issues.
      
      ### Problem: A VM Won't Start
      
      **Scenario: Diagnosing startup failures**
      
      ```
      Given I tried to start a VM but it failed
      When I check the error
      Then I should see a clear error message
      And I should know if it's:
      - A port conflict
      - A Docker issue
      - A configuration problem
      ```
      
      **What to check:**
      1. Is Docker running? `docker ps`
      2. Is the port already in use? `./scripts/vde list`
      3. Check the logs: `docker logs <vm-name>`
      
      ### Problem: Changes Aren't Reflected
      
      **Scenario: Rebuilding after configuration changes**
      
      ```
      Given I modified the Dockerfile to add a package
      And the VM is already running
      When I run "vde start python --rebuild"
      Then the VM should be rebuilt
      And the new package should be available
      ```
      
      **Rebuild with --rebuild:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde start python --rebuild
      ```
      
      **For complete rebuild (no cache):**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/vde start python --rebuild --no-cache
      ```
