## Key Directories Explained

### `.locks/`
VDE uses a deterministic FIFO locking model to manage concurrency.
- `global-config.lock`: Serializes modifications to the Beskar Registry.
- `vms/`: Per-Spoke locks for parallel builds and mass ignitions.
- `ports/`: Atomic reservations for SSH and service ports.

### `.docker-state/`
Contains JSON archives reflecting the real-time status of VDE containers. This directory ensures that `vde status` and `vde vision` remain accurate without polling the Docker daemon excessively.

### `bin/`
The unified command surface. **Mandate 10** requires all operations to flow through `bin/vde`.
- `vde`: The canonical command router (The Way).
- `vde-enforce-uap.zsh`: The Rule Spine sentinel (Governance).
- `vde-init`: The Initialization Ritual logic.
- `vde-path-of-the-foundling`: Interactive student onboarding.

### `lib/` (Standard Library)
Modular Zsh 5.0+ libraries following the **ZSH ONLY** mandate.
- `vm-common`: High-level Spoke orchestration.
- `vde-core`: Pathing, versioning, and deterministic execution.
- `vde-ssh`: The Sovereign Bridge (SSH management).
- `vde-docker`: Container lifecycle management.

### `projects/`
The primary workspace for language Spokes. Each subdirectory is mounted as a volume into the corresponding container at `$HOME/workspace/`.

### `data/`
Persistent storage for service Spokes (e.g., PostgreSQL databases, Redis dumps) and the authoritative **Beskar Registry** (`vm-types.json`).

### `env-files/`
Configuration payloads sourced by Docker Compose. These files contain the **Phase 31 DNS aliases** and Spoke-specific metadata.
