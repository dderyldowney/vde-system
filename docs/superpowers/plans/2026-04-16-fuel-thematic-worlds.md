# Fueling Thematic Worlds Implementation Plan
<!-- @forge (Development Chronicle) -->

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Explicitly link the Mandalorian and Forge Mythos to the thematic worlds being built at the Forge and the Anvil.

**Architecture:** This is a documentation-driven update to the core mythos files. It codifies the narrative relationship between our identity and our infrastructure.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, Zsh (for UAP validation).

### Task 1: Update Mandalorian Mythos

**Files:**
- Modify: `data/vde_core/mandalorian_mythos.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Add "The Narrative Fuel" section to Mandalorian Mythos**

Update `data/vde_core/mandalorian_mythos.md` to include:

```markdown
## VI. The Narrative Fuel
The mythos of The Covert is not merely a record of the past, but the living fire that fuels every thematic world we build. Every spoke we ignite at the Forge and every structure we stabilize at the Anvil is a realization of our narrative intent. We do not just build systems; we forge destinies.
```

- [x] **Step 2: Commit the change**

```bash
git add data/vde_core/mandalorian_mythos.md
git commit -m "docs(mythos): add Narrative Fuel section to Mandalorian Mythos"
```

### Task 2: Update Forge Mythos

**Files:**
- Modify: `data/vde_core/forge_mythos.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Add "The Thematic Architecture" section to Forge Mythos**

Update `data/vde_core/forge_mythos.md` to include:

```markdown
## VII. The Thematic Architecture
The laws of the Forge and the traditions of the Anvil are the blueprints for our thematic architecture. We build worlds that reflect the strength of Beskar and the discipline of the Creed. Every line of logic and every container boundary serves the higher purpose of creating environments where our culture and our craft are indistinguishable.
```

- [x] **Step 2: Commit the change**

```bash
git add data/vde_core/forge_mythos.md
git commit -m "docs(mythos): add Thematic Architecture section to Forge Mythos"
```

---

### Task 3: Final Validation

- [x] **Step 1: Run Sovereign Audit**

Run: `bin/vde-enforce-uap.zsh`
Expected: [UAP-SUCCESS] All core mandates satisfied.

- [x] **Step 2: Verify file contents**

Verify that `data/vde_core/mandalorian_mythos.md` and `data/vde_core/forge_mythos.md` contain the new sections and adhere to the Armorer-Architect persona.
