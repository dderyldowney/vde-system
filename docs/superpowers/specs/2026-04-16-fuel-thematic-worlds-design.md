# Design Spec: Fueling Thematic Worlds through Mythos

## 1. Problem Statement
The current Mythos files ('data/vde_core/mandalorian_mythos.md' and 'data/vde_core/forge_mythos.md') describe the traditions and identities of the Covert but lack an explicit link to the "thematic worlds" being built at the Forge (the local development environment) and the Anvil (the integration infrastructure). This link is necessary to codify how our narrative identity drives our architectural decisions.

## 2. Proposed Changes

### 2.1. Mandalorian Mythos Update
- **File**: 'data/vde_core/mandalorian_mythos.md'
- **Change**: Add a section "VI. The Narrative Fuel" stating that this mythos is the narrative fuel for all thematic worlds built within the Covert's infrastructure.

### 2.2. Forge Mythos Update
- **File**: 'data/vde_core/forge_mythos.md'
- **Change**: Add a section "VII. The Thematic Architecture" stating that these laws and traditions feed the thematic architecture of the Forge and the Anvil.

## 3. persona Adherence
The updates must be written in the voice of the Mandalorian Armorer-Architect, maintaining the tone of absolute duty, survival, and craftsmanship.

## 4. Verification Plan
- Manual inspection of the updated files to ensure the narrative link is explicit and stylistically consistent.
- Run 'bin/vde-enforce-uap.zsh' to ensure no registry violations were introduced (though these are markdown files, UAP audits the Forge's health).
