# TOKEN ECONOMY MODE (MANDATORY)
- Minimize token usage at all times.
- Concise responses: No verbose explanations.
- Skip insight blocks: Do NOT use ★ Insight formatting.
- Direct tool use: Use Read/Grep/Glob directly for simple tasks.
- Short commits: 1 subject line + 2-3 bullet points max.
- No task tracking for simple work: Use TaskCreate only for 5+ steps.
- Batch tool calls: Combine independent operations.
- Truncate summaries: End-of-task summaries must be 5 lines max.

## Forbidden Token Waste

- ❌ Long explanations before actions
- ❌ Restating what the user said
- ❌ Multiple agent spawns for simple searches
- ❌ Verbose error analysis (just fix it)
- ❌ Educational asides unless explicitly requested
