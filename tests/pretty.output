Feature: VM Information and Discovery # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:1
  As a developer using VDE
  I want to discover what VMs are available and get information about them
  So I can make informed decisions about my development environment
  Scenario: Listing all available VMs                      # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:6
    Given I have VDE installed                             # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1153
    When I ask "what VMs can I create?"                    # features/steps/ai_steps.py:169
    Then I should see all available language VMs           # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1159
    And I should see all available service VMs             # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1166
    And each VM should have a display name                 # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1173
    And each VM should show its type (language or service) # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1179

  Scenario: Listing only language VMs                               # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:14
    Given I want to see only programming language environments      # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1185
    When I ask "show all languages"                                 # features/steps/ai_steps.py:169
    Then I should see only language VMs                             # features/steps/parser_steps.py:693
    And I should not see service VMs                                # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1191
    And common languages like Python, Go, and Rust should be listed # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1197

  Scenario: Listing only service VMs                        # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:21
    Given I want to see only infrastructure services        # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1203
    When I ask "show all services"                          # features/steps/ai_steps.py:169
    Then I should see only service VMs                      # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1209
    And I should not see language VMs                       # features/steps/help_steps.py:86
    And services like PostgreSQL and Redis should be listed # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1215

  Scenario: Getting detailed information about a specific VM  # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:28
    Given I want to know about the Python VM                  # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1221
    When I request information about "python"                 # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1227
    Then I should see its display name                        # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1233
    And I should see its type (language)                      # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1239
    And I should see any aliases (like py, python3)           # features/steps/customization_steps.py:648
    And I should see installation details                     # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1245

  Scenario: Checking if a VM exists                  # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:36
    Given I want to verify a VM type before using it # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1251
    When I check if "golang" exists                  # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1257
    Then it should resolve to "go"                   # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1263
    And the VM should be marked as valid             # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1269

  Scenario: Discovering VMs by alias                         # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:42
    Given I know a VM by an alias but not its canonical name # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1275
    When I use the alias "nodejs"                            # features/steps/customization_steps.py:564
    Then it should resolve to the canonical name "js"        # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1287
    And I should be able to use either name in commands      # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1293

  Scenario: Understanding VM categories                                      # features/vm-information-and-discovery.feature:48
    Given I am new to VDE                                                    # features/steps/pattern_steps.py:347
    When I explore available VMs                                             # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1299
    Then I should understand the difference between language and service VMs # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1305
    And language VMs should have SSH access                                  # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1311
    And service VMs should provide infrastructure services                   # features/steps/vm_lifecycle_steps.py:1317
