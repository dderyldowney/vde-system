# VDE ARCHITECTURAL RECORD

Feature: Concurrency Lock-Queue Model (FIFO)
  As an Alor of the VDE
  I require deterministic sequencing of concurrent requests
  So that high-volume operations are served in arrival order

  @concurrency @fifo
  Scenario: Strict FIFO Ordering of Concurrent Requests
    Given the VDE system is healthy
    And the registry is reconciled
    When I launch 10 simultaneous "start python" requests at 0.0s intervals
    Then they should be served in the order they arrived
    And the final state should be all requests completed successfully
