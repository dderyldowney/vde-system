Feature: System Spine Integrity

  @spine @critical-path @user-guide-first-vm
  Scenario: Hub-to-Spoke Deterministic Ignition
    Given the VDE Hub "data/vm-types.conf" is the sole authority
    And the VDE Registry "data/vm-types.json" is synchronized with the Hub
    When I run the one true way to start "python"
    Then a VM-level lock should be created during ignition
    And the container "vde-python" should be started via direct Docker orchestration
    And the container should have been hydrated by "scripts/setup/python-init.zsh"
    And the SSH port should be atomically allocated and recorded in the registry
    And I should be able to SSH into "vde-python" and verify the environment

  Scenario: Full Language and Service Matrix Verification
    Given the VDE system is healthy
    Then every VM defined in the Hub must have a corresponding USP init script
    And every VM must be startable via the VDE orchestrator
    And every VM must adhere to the 8-field registry standard

  @user-guide-starting-stopping
  Scenario: VM Lifecycle Termination (Stop/Remove)
    Given the VDE Registry is loaded
    And "vde-python" is currently running
    When I run the one true way to stop "python"
    Then the container "vde-python" should be stopped
    And the VM-level lock should be released
    When I run the one true way to remove "python"
    Then the container "vde-python" should be destroyed
    And the SSH configuration should be preserved

  @bridge @docker-socket
  Scenario: Sovereign Docker Socket Access
    Given the VDE system is healthy
    And "vde-python" is currently running
    When I execute "docker ps" inside "vde-python" as "devuser"
    Then the command execution should succeed
    And the execution output should contain "vde-python"

  @bridge @ssh-forwarding @user-guide-ssh-keys
  Scenario: SSH Agent Forwarding Verification
    Given the VDE system is healthy
    And "vde-python" is currently running
    And I have identities loaded in my host SSH agent
    When I execute "ssh-add -l" inside "vde-python" as "devuser"
    Then the command execution should succeed
    And the output should contain my host identities

  @system-spine @critical-path @zsh
  Scenario: Pillar I - The Voice of the Tribe (Zsh)
    Given the Hub is active
    When I execute "zsh --version"
    Then the output should contain "zsh 5."
    And the return code should be 0

  @system-spine @critical-path @git
  Scenario: Pillar II - The Chronicler's Record (Git)       # tests/features/core-infrastructure/system-spine.feature:57
    Given a temporary workspace in "plans/scripts/git-test"
    When I execute "git init" in the workspace
    Then the directory ".git" should exist
    And the return code should be 0

  @system-spine @critical-path @docker
  Scenario: Pillar III - The World-Forge (Docker)
    Given the Docker daemon is responsive
    When I run a diagnostic probe with "docker run --rm alpine echo 'Forge Active'"
    Then the output should contain "Forge Active"
    And the return code should be 0

  @system-spine @critical-path @ssh
  Scenario: Pillar IV - The Transversal Bridge (SSH)
    Given the "vde_student" identity exists at "~/.ssh/vde/"
    When the SSH agent is active on the Hub
    And I execute "ssh-add -l"
    Then the output should contain "vde_student"
    And the return code should be 0

  @system-spine @image-purity @rule-12-5
  Scenario: Spoke Image Purity Verification (Rule 12.5)
    Given "vde-python" is currently running
    Then the directory "/var/lib/apt/lists/" should be empty in the Spoke
