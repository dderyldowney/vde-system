# Shellcheck configuration for VDE scripts
# This project uses zsh only - sh/bash scripts are forbidden

# Source scripts - can't follow non-constant or dynamic sources
exclude=SC1090
exclude=SC1091

# Variable appears unused (may be used in sourced files)
exclude=SC2034

# Allow Zsh-specific features
exclude=SC2039  # In POSIX sh
exclude=SC3043  # In POSIX sh

# Note: ShellCheck doesn't natively support zsh.
# SC5001 (require zsh shebang) would be ideal but isn't available.
# Project-wide enforcement is handled via STYLE_GUIDE.md and code review.
